                <p>
                    I learn programming since 2015, I started with C++, later I made some small projects with C#, then I was learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL. I also programmed Arduino. I study computer science since 2017. During my studies i had an opportunity
                    to understand the fundamentals of object oriented paradigm, observer and MVC patterns, data structures and algorithms commonly used in software development, basic UML diagrams, database design and mobile development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I'm working on an Android app, meant to simplyfy money managment for people whose assets are highly diversified and valued in different currencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also creating a C# desktop app, which's purpose is to simulate behaviour and evolution of simplified animals in a changing enviroment containing only sand, stone, water and soil, on which grass can grow and densen. There are two types of animals:
                    sheep and wolves. Sheep can eat the grass, slowing it's growth or destroying it. Wolves can eat sheep. All the animals have to eat and drink once in a while to survive. They can also replicate to increase their population, which creates
                    sheep or wolves with genomes of their parents mixed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The page you're seing is also fully created by me, with just pure HTML and CSS.
